# Projects Repository

This repository contains several independent projects exploring algorithms, simulations, and game development.

## 📌 Projects

### 🔬 Critical State Self-Organizing (Sandpile Model)
📂 → `Critical state self-organizing/`  
A simulation of a self-organizing critical system.  
Observe how a sandpile organizes itself under different conditions and explore the mathematical concepts behind this phenomenon.

### 📱 QR Code Generator
📂 → `QR Code/`  
A QR code generator built from scratch.  
⚠️ This project is still a work in progress and is not fully functional yet.

### 🎮 Tetris
📂 → `Tetris/`  
A playable Tetris game.  
You can either play the game yourself or watch a bot play automatically.

### 🧭 Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
📂 → `Traveling salesman problem/`  
An implementation of a brute-force algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.  
The goal is to find the shortest possible path that visits all points exactly once.
